ln 1569 he married Agnes Lawson, as appears from a

. contract, on 25th November, between Mr. John Spens ol Condie,

and Mr. Alexander Betoune, Erchdeine ol Lawtheane, on the
one part, and Mr. Gilbert Skene, Doctoure ol Medicine, and
Agnes Lausone, his luture spouse, on the other. She was, as
appears lrom another contract ln 1583, relict ol John Uddart,

been named executrix, but was unable to procure a nomination ;
