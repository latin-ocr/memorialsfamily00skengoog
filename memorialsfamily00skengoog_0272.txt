divorce betuixt sin and my soul . ‘

my soul never to fall into any known sin, and more particularly to guard
against any idol sin, never to give it a kyndly look any more And now,
Almi'ghty, all-seeing Lord, what is done on earth let it be ratified iu

0 ALMIGHTY, Dreadful, Covenant·keeping Lord, who searches the heart
and tryes the remes, Ι have run farr away from thee, 1 have sind against
heaven and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy sone, Ο
that thou woldst make me as the meanest of thy servants, yet since of
thy infinit mercy thou hast provided mercy to all that turn in unto thee,
1 desayre trembling to come and fall down before thee, to through away
all the weapons of my rebellion, and wholly to submitt myself to thy
laws.
And since thou hast promised to all, such as forsake their evil ways
and tum to thee with their whole beart, that thou wilt be their God, and
they shall be thy people,
