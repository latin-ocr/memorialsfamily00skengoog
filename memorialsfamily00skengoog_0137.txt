’ In consequence'of this appeal a sum· 01 money was directed'to be

Among the. Curriehill papers is the following receipt, ‘⁴ I, Sir John

1811 John Skene held the office of Clerk Register till the year 1612,
and we find him employing several of his relations as servitors or clerks.
Among them were Mr. Andrew Skene, ancestor of the Skenes 01 Hal-
yards in· Fife, Mr. Robert Skene, son 01 his brother, Mr. James Skene
of ¹Westercorse, and throughout the whole time, James Skene, son of his
brother, Robert Skene. The Record of the Privy Seal is full of grants
ἱ 10 these servitors 01 escheats and nonentries, bringing with them con·

, ln 1596 there is a crown charter to him and Helen Somerville, his
wife, of the lands 01 Rannalloch, in Aberdeenshire

ln 1598 there is a charter to him and Helen Somerville, his wife, of
thedominical lands of Reidhall, in Midlothian; aud in 1599 a charter to
them of these lands, along with the east half of Gorgie In 1604 he
purchased the lands 01 Curriehill for 20,000 merks; and there is a
charter to them 01 the lands of Hill, commonly called Curriehill, in ’
Midlothian, from which he took his title ·

Sir John Skene’s official lise closes in 1612, when he resigned the
lucrative and important office 01 Clerlr Register, in favour 01 his eldest
son, Sir James Skene, who was, however, persuaded to accept the office
01 an Ordinary Lord 01 Session instead, to the great annoyance 01
his father. Spottiswood, in his history, gives the following account :-
“Sir John Skene 01 Curriehill„ in 1611, on *account of his age and
infirmity, intending to resign his situation of Clerle Register in favour 01
