Loving Mother- 2⁹

Ι am sorry to give you the disconsolate newes ol' your sones death

about iour weeks ago. He was taken witha violent cholick, and upon
that a strong lever with stitclres in -his right side, so that it hes pleased
the Lord to take him to himself. He departed upon Tuesday last, being
the 25th (new style), with his full understanding and compleatt sences.
After that the doctors had all given him over I had three severale
consultationes ¹ol the best Docters in Town to soe il' ther was any
possible remedy, but against death ther is none. He was so entirely

beloved ol' all, that all or most ol' the officers in generall of the garrisone
conveyed him to his buriall place (with great Lamentationc), which was
in the French Church, wher he was most honorably interred, both sor my
own particular respect, as also‘os you and all his friends. l doubt not
but you will sympathize with my diseonsolate conditione, considering how
1 am stated, with a young child, and another in my belly. Ι know not
well what to doe, only I cast mysell upon God, who cares l'or the widow
and satherless, and upon my gdod friends. Ι shall patiently wait your ·
answer and advice what lshall doe. Your son many times said that he
had a great desire, il it had pleased God, to have seen you once more had
it been possible. Be pleased to signifie his death to all our good friends
with my most entire love to them all. Ι hope you will do your endeavour
and employ our friends to see to procure me a pensione. No more, but
recommending you to the care os the Almighty, Ι rest, Loving Mother,

Your affectionate daughter,
