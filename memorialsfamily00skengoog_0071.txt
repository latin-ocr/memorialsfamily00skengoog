of his life Had it not been for the violence of his political opinions, and
the dissipated life to which he was addicted, he was a man of talenta and
dispositions calculmod to have made a figure ln ¹the comer of the country
wherehis fortune and the antiquity of his family entitled him to take a
lead. But in spite of these disadvantageous circumstances, his acuteness
in the public affairs of the county, and remarkably conciliatory manner,
continued, during the course of his life, to give great weight to his opinion
at the meetings of the Freeholders. He never married ; and having
lived to see every member of his family of the natue of Skene ,disappean

of the window and walked 17 miles home to Inverie. On the occasion
of a return visit of the laird to Inverie, the editor-tuen a little boy-
had been promised by his father that hc would take him out next morning
with him, when he proposed to fish for salmom but when he was detained
till a late bour at the dinner table, seeing that the laird had drunlr himself
