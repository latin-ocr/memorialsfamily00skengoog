Skene 01 yat ilke. At vthat tyme the family being weak and under
burdens, he married Elizabeth Black, daughter to a burgess 01 Aberdeen,
with whom he got in dott and tocher good all that tract 01 land called tlte

round table ;” and MS.D adds-u being that part 01 the town 01 Aber-
deen bounded on the east with the (Iastle Strcet or present Exchange, on

- the south with the Exchequer Row, and on the west with the Rotten

Row, and on the north with the Narrow Wynd. Besides these houses,
he got a considerable sum 01 money with her.'’ No doubt the protracted
struggle with the principal family of the Keiths Marischal would, in some
degree, account for the depressed state of the family. Alexander Skene
was, as we have seen, in pupillarity when his father died in 1507, and
attained majority in 1514, as in that year he obtains, 011 8th May, a
charter 01 the Tanistry lands, from “Alexander Comes Crawsordiae et
Dominus de Lindesay et dominus omnium et singularum terrarum de
Tulibroloch, Tullynahiltis, Balnadodill, le Comeris, Auchorye, Auchmo'r
et molendini ejusdem Alexandro Skeyne filio et heredi quondam
Alexandri Skeyne de eodem ;'' and among the witnesses is “Johannes
Skeyne de Auchterarnanc.”

On 17th July‚ in the same year, he is inleft as heir, served and
retoured, to Alexander Skene, his father, in the lands and barony 01 Skene.

In 1516 he married Elizabeth Black, as on 20th May in that year h'e
receives a Crown charter to himsels and Elizabeth Black, his sponse, 01
the lands 01 Newton in Skein and Letter, in Baronia de Skene, by his
own resignation, as her jointure lands. He seems to have died in 1517.

Mr. Alexander Skene says 01 him—“ Alexander Skenacommonly
designed the little laird, who was left a child in his mother’s womb when

’ his father, fighting 101 his king and country, was slain in the battle 01

Pinkey. Theresore, he being the only child 01 his umquhill father, his
land fell ward in the king’s hands. The laird 01 Drum being at that time
at Court, got the gift 01 his ward, which he gave to the laird 01 Corsenday
101 a horse; and the said Corsenday took the tutilage of the child, till
such tyme as he was 101 marriage, and then gave him 10,000 merks 01
tocher, with his own daughter in marriage, called Margaret Forbes.”
This is a good specimen 01 the character 01 such family traditions. They
