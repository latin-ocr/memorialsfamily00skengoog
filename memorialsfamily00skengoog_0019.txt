Appendix (Nor.) When Ι approached the present ¹generation
of my own family Ι felt myself treading on delicate ground, as
1 naturally desired to do justice to the members of it, and
especially to the character and accomplishments so generally

recognised of my late father, but was afraid that Ι might be led into
over laudation. l was therefore glad, in the case of my father,
to be able to substitute for my own account the obituary notice
of him addressed to the, Royal Society of Edinburgh, by so
distinguished a man as Sir David Brewster, and to conclude
the Appendix by adding the well-known lines addressed to him
by his life-long friend, Sir Walter Scott (App. x.) >

l was also glad tube able to supply the full-page illustrations
to this volume from the collection of my father’s drawings, part
of which had already appeared in the edition of Spalding’s
Troubles, printed for the Bannatyne Club.

1 have, in conclusion, to record my thanks to my friend,
Charles Elphinstone-Dalrymple, Esq, for the kind interest he
has taken in the work, and the judicious advice 1 have received
from him ; and also to the Secretary of the New Spalding Club,
P. J. Anderson, Esq, who has kindly revised my proof sheets,
and given me many valuable suggestions from time to time.

I have only to add, that in compiling the history of so many

branches of the family, l may occasionally have been led into ·

inaccuracies of date or statement, for which 1 hope to meet with
indulgence

WILLIAM F. SKENE.
