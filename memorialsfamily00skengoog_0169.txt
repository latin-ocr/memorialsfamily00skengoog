three daughters before a son was born, he entered into a treaty with
the magistrates of Aberdeen, superiors of the lands of Rubislaw, tq
have the holding altered from a male fee to heirs whatsoever, which was
obtained upon payment of {250 sterling. It was intended by the late
Mr. Skene that his son should follow the profession of the law, with
which view, while a youth, he attended the office of his uncle, Thomson
of Portlethen; but unfortunately his disposition was of too lively a cast

occurred in the year 1776, of which he died on the 24th January, at the
age of 4o'' (Mau).

His legal studies do not, however, seem to have been utterly fruitless,
