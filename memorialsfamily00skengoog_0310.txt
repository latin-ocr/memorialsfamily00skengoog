Your Committee have also considered the propriety of
printing under the auspices ‘of the Clubthe recently discovered
“ Lives of the Saints ’¹ attributed to Barbour. They were
favoured with the views of Professor Masson on this subject.
That eminent scholar is of opinion that the “Lives of the Saints”
in its entirety naturally falls to be edited by the Scottish Text
Society‚ but that a volume of ‘⁸ Barbouriana‚'' containing all that

your Committee would heartily recommend it.

regarding which no exact information is as yet before the

Committee, are “The Book of Banff,” by Mr. W. Cramond,
Cullen, and a new edition of “The Book of Bon-Accord’f by
