l, Geo. Skene, do her take heaven and earth to reoord that l take the
great God, Father, Sone, and Holy Ghost, for my portion and chief good,
and do give up mysell, soul and body, wholly to thy semice, and to
strengthen thus my resolution, 1 promise to vow and forsake all that is
dear unto me in a world, rather than to forsake thee, and that no tempta·
¹tlon to sin shall withdraw me from thy service, promising and vowing to
serve thee in holiness and righteousness all the days of my life

And since thou hast appointed Christ as theonly way for lost sinners
to come to thee, Ι doe here, upon the bended knees, of my soul and body
accept ol' Christ, as the only way by which l, ane lost, nodone wretch,
may have access uoto thee, and do here solemnly joyn myself in a mar-
riage covenant to be his for ever, to take him as my alon Lord and
Saviour, without whom 1 am undone through etemity. Ι hear take him for
my head and husband, to be ruled and govemed by him, and that Ι do
sake my lott with him, come what will come I’ll never forsake him,
, verily, supposing that neither death nor lyfe shall separate me from the
love of God in Jesus Christ

Onely Lord let not unallowed misscarriages make void this everlast-
ing covenant betwixt thee and my soul. Ι

And since Ο Lord, Ι am unable of myself to think a good thought,
’ much less to keep closs with the throughout my lyf, therefore Ι vow to
perform only through the assistance of thy spirit ; never leave me, therefor,
nor forsake me, for if thou leave me Ι cannot stand one moment. Now,
l, G. S, again call thee to witness the sinceritie of my beart, and that 1
doe it without any grudge, solemnly promising and vowing to own the
for my Lord, and live to thee so long as Ι have a breathing tyme here
(even so help me God), and now what is done on earth, lett it be ratified
in heaven.

(Signed) Gso. Suana

ln confirmation whereof Ι seal it wlth my hand, and wish 1 could doe
it with my blood, upon the bended knees both of my soul and
body. ,
