state facts which are or may be true enough, but attribute them to wrong
persons and dates. It seems true that he was a posthumous child, and
the account given by MS.D of the reason why he was called “the little
laird,” bears all the appearance of probability. “ He was killed at the
battle of Pinkie in 1547, and was called the little laird from his being
hunchbacked from a fall he got out of his nurse’s arms whe'n going up
the ladder to the old house 01 Skene'’ But it errs in saying that he was
killed at the battle of Pinkie‚ as Mr. Alexander Skene does in saying his
father was killed in that battle. ,

Mr. Alexander Skene is also mistaken in saying that the gift of
his ward was given to the laird of Dmm, and by him transferred to the
laird of Corsinday, for, as we have seen, it was his father whose ward was
given to Sir Alexander lrving of Drum and Duncan Forbes 01 Corsinday,
and ‘⁴ the little laird,” as he was called, was under the guardianship of his
uncle, James Skene, for we find, on and November, 1538,111 a mutual ‘
agreement between Alexander Skeyne of that ilk and Mr. Walter
Styvart, regarding the marches 01 the lands 01 Tullibroloch, belonging
to the former, and Tullocht belonging to the latter, that Alexander
Skeyne becomes bound, with the consent 01 his uncle and curator, James
Skeyne‘(Protocol Book 01 John Christisone), and he came 01 age in the
following year, as on 22nd March, 15 39, he is infeft in the lands and
barony of Skene, as heir served and retoured, to Alexander Skene 01 that
ilk, his father. . . · 2
- Neither was he ever at the battle 01 Pinkie, for when the trumpet call
to this great national conflict resounded over all Scotland, and caused
many a quiet laird to buckle on his armour, we find in the record of the
Privy Seal-“ Ane brieve maid to Alexander Skeyne 01 yat ilk, giving
leave to him to remain fra ustin al ye days of his life, because he is wake
01 complexion and inhabill 101 travel, vexit with infirmities and sikness,
providedalwayis that the said Alexander sends ane habill fumished man,
with bis household and servants, to the said oistis at St Andrews, penult
October, 1546.'' The ‘⁸ habill fumished man” was his uncle, James Skeyne
in Bandodle, and he it was, as we shall afterwards see, who, with other
Skeynes, was slain at the fatal battle 01 Pinkie.

Itis true, however, that he married a daughter of Duncan Forbes of
, Corsinday, 101 011 18111 March, 1541, there is a charter “Alexandro Skene
