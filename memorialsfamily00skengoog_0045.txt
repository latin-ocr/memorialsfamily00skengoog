20 SKENE OF· susum

seems now to have passed to Janet de Keith, only daughter of Robert de
Keith‚ who was eldest son of -William, first Earl Marischal, and brother
of William, second Earl Marischal, and was thus heir, of line of the
family ; and on 26th April, 145 7, she obtained a decreit from the Sheriff,
upon a brief oi richt, dated 21st February, 1456, between “Jacobus de
Skene de eodem et Joneta de Keth cum patruosuo nobili Domino
Willelmo domino de Keth Mariscallo Scocie de et super terris de ly
Ledach de Skene de ly Kirktoun de Skene de Mulboy et de Garlogy,”
on which the Jury‚ after hearing evidence “antiquorum virorum,” gave
their verdict “quod Jacobus de Skene supradictus habet majus jus
quam habet dicta Joneta de Keith in et ad dictas terras ;” and on 30th ,
April, jacobus Skene de eodem is infeft in these lands.

The Keith family did not, however, notwithstanding these proceedings‚
relax their grasp of them, and the scene oi litigation was now transferred
to Parliament‚ and a declaration was obtained, on 7th November, 1457,
from the King, through the Chanccllor of the Kingdom, that James de
Skene was to reirain from retaining the rents of these lands till the fourth
day of the meeting of Parliament‚ in the month of March next Before
this Parliament the following protestation was made by his son and heir,
Alexander, whose position-was strengthened by his taking inieftment on
a charter confirming “Alexandro Skene filio et haeredi apparenti Jacobi
Skene de eodem,” the charter of King Robert the First to Robert Skene
of the Barony of Skene :—
