directed to the repositories ol old tanrily houses and sarm-houses,
there is reason to think that the results might be surprisingly
satisfactory, and that documents ol historical value, whose very
existence is at present unknown, or little more than known,
might be brought to light; while, with regard to others, fuller
and more accurate inlormation might now be obtained. Should
this fortunately prove to be the case, there can be little doubt
that the possessors ol such works will be ready to second the
Club in its endeavour to have them duly recorded, and is possible
placed where they can be easily accessible to present and future
students. ln the case where sor any reason the owners are
unwilling to part with their property, it would be desirable to
have, along with the strict bibliographical account ol the works,
an intimation ol the owners' names, and such information 're-
specting the works and their authors as can be gleaned.

ln carrying out the second object above mentioned, the aim
in the first place should be to encourage the preservation os
local publications which have just ceased to be ol present value
and use, but as yet have not passed into the state os venerable
dignity and worth. This is the crucial stage in the history os
all published works, and in their passage through it many a
volume disappears, os which the historical student has to mourn
the loss ln the next place, in surtherance ol the same object,
asystematic eliort should be made to record the current publi·
cations os the day which have any literary or historic connection
with the district. Under this designation are included not only
books and pamphlets printed and published in it, or written by
natives os it, though printed elsewhere; but also suchpublica·
