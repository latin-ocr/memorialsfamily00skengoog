Dear and Loving Mother, Sisters and Brother,-

Since it is the pleasure oi the Almighty God to lay his hand on me,
and by all appearance litle or no hopes os recovery, my disease being
given over by all my physicians,1 having taken it by a severe grave
colique, which continued ior some days, and at last being found that it is
a putrification in my lungs, that my only recourse is to the Almighty
God 3ηά my Saviour Jesus Christ, and to be in unity with all men.
soe my Dear mother, sisters 3ηά brother, wherein I have offended you, Ι
first ask pardon ol God, and then oi you all, and begs eamestly off you
all that is my Heavenly Father shall remove me from this world to his
heavenly rest, that you will take this pooi woman, my dear and Loving
wyff and children, in your motherly, sisterly, 3ηά brotherly care, ior
believe me wee shall never bein capacity to repay her ior the care that
she hath taken oi me Soe my Dear Mother, sisters and brother, this
being my earnest and last desire to you all, and while 1 arn here my
prayers shall allwise be ior you, recomending you all to the protection of
the Almighty God, and hopping that this, my last desire, shall be granted.

1 rest, Dear and Loving Mother, sisters and brother, your ever affec-
tionate and Loving son and brother, while 1 am upon this side oi time.

Heuou P susus, his
