Spalding Club‚ and on which the Editor relied as his principal
guide, has been sound to be so imperfect and inaccurate as· to ne-

Mr. Temple has elected to withdraw his offer, and to publish
the book in the ordinary way, as he had originally intended. lt
would certainly have been uniair to expect that he should curtail
or mutilate a book, the result ol great industry and research, and
