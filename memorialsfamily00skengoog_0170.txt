extinct, he appears to have formed a plan to prove his own representa·
tion of the family, and take up the dormant baronetcy. With this view
we find him having his papers examined byan antiquary and genealogist
of some local celebrity, the late Mr. Rose of Banff; but an accident which
befel the charter chest destroyed many of the family papers, and
prevents us from knowing more than the result of the examination.
“Upon the death of George Skene of Rubislaw, on 24th January, 1776,
the charter chest was convcyed to Aberdeen, and deposited ln the house
of the late Alexander Camegie, Esq, Town Clerk. Being of iron, and
very weighty, it was left in a low, damp appartment, or rather cellar,
with an earthen floor, which, in the period of one-and·twenty years that
it was suffered to be exposed to damp, so completely rotted the bottom
of the chest, that upon its removal, the bottom remained on the ground,
reduced to an ochry clay, and with it a layer of about three inches thick
of the old family parchments and papers, in a state of destruction utterly
irredeemable, in fact resembling a mass of rotten tobacco, which fell to
pieces on being touched '' (MS.E). ·

Mr. Rose, however, had · noted some of its contenta in his note
books, in which are the following entries :-

“Sir James Skene of Curriehill, created knight baronet, which l have
seen at Robslaw.’'

“ Skene, Sir James, of Curriehill, knight and baronet, President of the '

College of Justices, died at Edinburgh, interred in Greyfriars, aoth
October, 1633. Represented by Robslaw.”

His early death probably prevented the claim from being prosecuted,
and the patent which seems to have come into his possession perished
with the rest of the destroyed papers.

George Skene of Rubislaw left the following children, by his wife,
Jane Moir, who died in Edinburgh on 29th March, 1820, aged 79,
having been 44 years a widow.

1. Margaret Skene, born 4th September, 1767; married Colonel

Ramsay of the and or Queen's Regiment of Foot, and had issue

11. Helen Skene, born 13th August, 1768; remained unmarried, and

died at Florence in 1841.
