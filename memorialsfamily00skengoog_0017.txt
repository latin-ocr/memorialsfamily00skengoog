Σ. PREFACE,

wquired as property. or else demanded to the conditiones
ordinary sarmers Then some generations latet we see the
inex-ming trade os the country, and the new ideas and new lise
infused into society by the Reformation, sending the younger
sons of such families to seek thffl'r subsistente· in other fields.
We see thern now obtaining a better education' tn the newly
founded Colleges, some os them taking a ⁴University degree,
and distinguished frorn their less cultivated brothers by tbe title
os ⁴·Mr.,’· a designation at that time exclusively confined to
Masoers os Arts; md then sometimes teaching sor some years in
their College as Regents. We can see those who would have
entered the Church becoming Notat-im Public, adopting lamed
prosessions. or becoming Professors in these Colleges. We mn
see others breaking through the aristoemtic line of demarmtion
between land and Burgh, and, becoming burgesses off the
County town. whence, if they were prosperous in trade, they
again emerged and founded new County families by purehasing
land, Add to this the foundation os the Cullege os Justice and
the increasing trade between Scotland and the Netherlasids and
Poland, in which Aberdeen took a large share. and we can see
the scions of County families resorting to one or other as an
outlet sor their energies, and a means of acquiring farne and
fortune,

We can thus see the sons os one obscure Notary Public
on Deeside furnishing a Professor of Medicine, who became
Physician to the King, and a learned Advocate. who was ⁴⁸ a
good, trew, stout man, like a Dutche man¹ and culd mak them
lang haral-ignes in Latin.'' sent as Ambsssador to Foreign
Courts. and oecupying the high position of Lord Clerk Register,
receiving letters from learned persons abmad (App. m), and
laudatory verses at horne (App. ιιι), while his last years are
embittered by disputes among his sons, and the efforts which
the Archbishop of St. Andrews nari-ates in such quaint language
