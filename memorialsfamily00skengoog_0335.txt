(approved at tlu First Annual General Mccting of tlte Club, on
Thursdoy,271h October, 1887).

Tun Couucu have much pleasure in reporting that the affairs
of the New Spalding Club are in a satisfactory state, and that
its prospecte are encouraging.

Considering the short time the Society has existed, the
number of applications for admission has been large, affording
gratifying evidence that the taste for such objects as it was
formed to encourage is very widely diflused.

lt will be in the recollection ol members that, at the meeting
on the 11th November, 1886, at which the Club was constituted,
the number of members was fixed at 400. That limit was
reached within twenty-four hours afterwardsâ€”and the applica-
tions came in so fast that another meeting ol the Club was
called, for the 16th December following, to consider whether
the membership might not be extended. lt was then, after full
discussion, fixed at 500. By the 22nd of December that further
limit had been reached, and it may be noted that 61 members
of the old Club, 19 of them original members, are of the
number. There are now upwards of 40 candidates waiting for
admission, who will come in according to priority of application.

It will, we feel assured, give much satisfaction to the
members to leam that Her Majesty the Queen has intimated
