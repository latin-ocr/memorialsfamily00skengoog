When the tired ploughman, dry and wann,
Hears halsasleep, the rising storm ’
Hurllng the hail, and eleeted· rain,
Against the casement's tlnkling pane3 ’
The sounds that drlve wild deer, and lox,
To shelter ln the brake and rocks,

Are wamings which the shepherd ask

To dismal and to dangerous tasle

0st he looks forth, and hopes, ln vain,
The blast may slnk ln mellowing rai'n3
Till, dark above, and white below,
Decided drives the flaky snow,

And forth the hardy swain must go.
Long, with dejected look and whlne,

To leave the hearth his dogs repine3
Whistling and cheering them to aid,
Around his back he wreathes the plaid:
His flock he gaulere, and he guides,

To open downs, and mountain-sides, ,
Where fiercest though the tempest blow,
Least deeply lies the drist below. ’
The blast, that whistles o'er the l’ells,
Stiflens his locks to icicles;

Ost he looks back, while streaming l’ar,
His cottege window seems a star,-
Looes its seeble glan-and then

Turns patient to the blast again,

And, lacing to the tempest's sweep,
Drlves through the gloom his lagglng sheep.
Is falls his heart, is his limbs fail,
Benumbing death is in the gale:

His paths, his landmarks, all unknown,
Close to the hut no more his own,

Close to the aid he sought ln vain,

The morn may find the stiffen’d swain:
The wldow sees, at dawning pale,

His orphans raiae their leeble wail3
