Cragydarg jacen in Baronia de Skene in conjuncta infeodatione super
resignationem dieti Alexandri”

Notwithstanding Alexander Skeyne being “ vexit with infirmities and
rikness,'' he was longer in possession of the barony than any other laird,
was twice married, had a large family of children, lived to see his eldest
son and heir and his son and heir both married, was predeceased by his
grandson, saw his greatgrandchildren, and died in the year 1604, at the
age of 87.

The author of MS.B refers to this period when he says-‘⁶ There were
foyve lairdes at on tym, with from father, son, grandchyld, gryt-grand-
chyld, and gryt-great·grandchyld,designed by the laird of Skene elder,
the laird of Skene younger, the laird of the Letter, 810, being parcel of the
Barronie of Skene; and each succeeded another in a short space.''

On 27th August, 1557, “Alexander Skene de eodem fecit constituit
et creavit proles suos sequentes suos assignatos irrevocabiles in et ad
summam mille mercatum monetae Scotiae quam habuit in deposito vizt
Gulielmum Skene ejus hlium ad 300 merks, Patricium Skene ejus fr.
filium ad 300 merks et deficien dicto Patricio Alexandrum Skene ejus .
fr. filium et Agnetem Skene ejus filiam ad 400 merks” (Ab. Sas Rege),
no doubt part of the tocher he got with Elizabeth Forbes

ln the following year Agnes was married evidently to a relation of his
mother, as we find in the Burgh Sasine Register, on 16th February, 1558
-“ Possessio of John Black and Agnes Skene, his future spouse, of
Auchmoir, in Baronla de Tillibrohloch, on precept of sasine from Alex-
ander Skene of Skene.''

On roth January, 1566, Alexander Skene de eodem is infeft in the
Burgh Suburbs belonging to the family, and one of the witnesses is Gilbert
¹ Skene, his son. .

His mother, Elizabeth Black, appears to have died in 1573, as on 4th
March in that year ‘⁴ Alexander Skene de eodem haeres Alexandri
Skene de eodem,” serves heir ‘⁴ in terris de Newton de Skeyne, et Letter
de Slreyne,'’ which were his mother’s jointure lands.

There seems to havebeen some quarrelling about the burgh lands, as,
1 in the Register of the Privy Council, the following entry occurs on 9th
February, 1566 :—“ Registration by Mr. Robert Irving, as procurator of
Band, by Alexander Skein of that ilk, for James Skein of Bandodill‚
Gilbert Skein, Mr. Patrick Skene, and Alexander Skene, ‘my lawful
