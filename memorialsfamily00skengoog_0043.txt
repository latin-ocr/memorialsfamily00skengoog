de Keth, Marischal of Scotland, by Adam de Skene, Lord of the same,
father of James de-Skene of that ilk, and that said lands were impig-
norated seu fomalyt for two or three hundred merks Scots, and this was

about 21 years ago, and that it was shown to him by Mariota, then
“Domina de Keth.” The second witness, William de Sancto Michaele‚
depones that he was present when the previous witness saw a charter or
evidence made in favour of William Lord Keith, by Adam de Skene, of
the lands of Ester Skene, scaled with two seals, a round one of the said
Adam, and an oval one of the Bishop of aberdeen, and that John Pet·
karne told him that it was a deed made by Adam de Skene, superfor-
nalyn, of Ester Skene, for 304 marks. A third witness, William Norvele,
depones that he was present in the house of Lord William de Keth,
Marischal of Scotland in the town of Aberdeen, before the battle of
Harlaw‚ when Lord John Stewart of lnvermey‚ and David Berlrley of
Mernys‚ instigated the said Lord William de Keth to found two chaplain-
ries, for the souis of himself and the Lady Margaret, his wife; and that
Lord William agreed to assign twenty merks of the lands of Ester Skene,
with its pertinents‚ for two chaplains, in the Cathedral of Aberdeen, but
the said Lady Margaret declared, in a loud and clear voice, that she never
would consent to the chaplainries being founded out of the lands of Ester
Skene, because they had no right to the said lands; upon which the
Earl Marischal said, in a rage, that he would not found a single chap-
lainrie for their souls, but at length, after consulting with the said Lord
John Stewart and David Berkley, assigned an annual payment of twenty·
two merks for two chaplains, to celebrate for ever in the Cathedral of
Aberdeen, out of the lands of Ester Skene, with warrandice from the
lands of Kyntor‚ should the lands of Ester Skene fail them; and the
Lady Margaret consented to this warrandice: the Earl then sent for
Sir John Yoill‚ priest‚ and Thomas Spryng‚ Burgess of Aberdeen, who
read, among other documents, the deed by Adam de Skene, regarding the
lands of Ester Skene, by which they were somalr't for three hundred
merks, and which deed was scaled with two seals, the round seal of
Adam, and the oval seal of the Bishop of Aberdeen. interrogated
whether he deponed these things from party or prejudice, hatred or love, '
. he replied, that it was not so, but for the safety of his soul, to avoid
the excommunication which he heard widely published‚ with sounding
bells, lighted and extinguished candles, by the reverend fathers in Christ
