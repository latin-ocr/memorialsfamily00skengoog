34 SKENE OF SKENE.

Marischall and others, touching the exhibition of all infeitments,
charters, dre, alleged made and granted to the said Earl or his prede-
cessors (of whom a long line is enumerated), “be the said Alexander Skene,
now of that ilk; umquhile James Skene of that ilk, Ιώ guidsir; umquhile

decreet granted by any sovereign back to King Robert Bruce, of and
eonceming the lands and barony of Skene, and loch of Skene, to be
considered by the said Lordsfand to have the same lawfully improvin,
δια, the parties compeiring by their procurators, and compeiring also Mr.
Andro Skene of Halyairds, taking burden on him for the said laird of
Skene” Submission being entered into for amicable settlement of
matters, the Lords “decree and ordain the said Alexander Skene to
resign in favour of the Earl Marisehal‚ all claim to the lands of Kirktown
of Skene, Ledach, Mylnebowie, and Garlogie‚ with the pertinents, to be
bruikit be the said Earl in his own proper lands in all time coming.
Lyke as the saide Lords arbitrators declairit that the loch of Skene, nor
no pairt thairof, is naways comprehendit under the decreet arbitral.'’

These documents are interesting, as showing both the Latin and the
corresponding Scotch technical names designating the steps in a pedigree ;
and if the lairds of Skene failed eventuallyto·redeem these lands under
the clause of reversion in the impignoration of them, they had at all
events the satisfaction of having successfully resisted a similar attempt, on
the part of the Strachans of Carmylie, to redeem the lands of Tillibirloch
and others, forming the Tanistry lands of the family.
