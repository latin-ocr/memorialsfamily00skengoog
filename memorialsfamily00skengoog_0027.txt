“ Parentalia, or Genealogical Notes with reference to the different families
ι of the name of Skene and others allied to the family of Skene of Rubislaw,
collected from various sources by James Skene, 1820.’' This manuscript

those old persons in whose memory they were still preserved.

The following memorials are compiled partly from these manuscript
bistones, and partly from documents among the family papers,or extracted
from the public records. Where no references are added, they are from
documents in the various charter chests.
