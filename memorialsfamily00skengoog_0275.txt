APPENDIX No, Χ.

Yet now, days, weeks‚ and months but seem
The recollection os a dream,

So still we glide down to the sea

Of salhomless etemity.

Even now it„scare‚ely secmea day,
Since first 1 tun’d this idle lay ;- · -
A task so often thrown aeide,
ν When leisure graver cares denied,
That now, November’s dreary g'ale,
Whose voice inspir'd my opening tale,
That same November gale once more
Whirls the dry leaves on Yanow shore.
⁸ Their vex'd boughs streaming to the sky,
Once more our naked birches sigh,
And Blackhouse heights, and Ettrick Pen,
Have donn'd their wintry shrouds again:
Andtmountain dark‚ and flooded mead‚
Bid us lorsake the banks os Tweed.
Earlier than wont along the sky,
Mix'd with the rack, the snow mists fly.
The shepherd‚ who in summer sun,
Had something oi our envy won,
As thou with pencil, l with pen,
The features traced oi hill and glen;
He who, outstretch’d the livelong day,
At ease among the heath·flowers lay,
View'd the light clouds with vacant look,
Or slumber’d o’er his tattered book,
Or idly busied him to guido
His angle o’er the lessen'd tide 3-
At midnight now, the snowy plain· · .
Finds stemer labour sor the swain.

When red hath set the beamles's sun,
Through henvy vapours darlr and dun;
