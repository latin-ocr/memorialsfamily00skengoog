SKENE OF HALYARDS IN MIDLOTHIAN.

1.-Mn. Jonn Sirene,

second son of Sir John Skene oi Curriehill, Lord Register. “He being
also a man oi great knowledge in our laws, was appointed Clerk oi the
Bilis, and one of the principal Clerks os Session.”

On 5th March, 1614, Sir James Skene, on becoming a Lord oi
Session, resigned the Clerkship of the Bills to him.

“He afterwards acquired the landp and barony of Halyards, in
Lothian, which became the chief title oi, his family ” (Man)

There is a charter under the great seal, ‘¹ Magistro Johanni Skeen de
Halyards uni clericorum Collegii Justitiae terrarum Baroniae de Hal·
yards, &c.,'' dated 24th March, 1650. ‘f This was part os the ancient
lordship of Liston, in the parish os Newliston, the original domain os the
knights templars, afterwards os the lordship oi St. John os Jemsalem ”
He must have been a person oi some accomplishment, as he is
undoubtedly the author of the MS. collection of old Scottish airs, which
has been printed by the Bannatyne ,Club, under the title os the Skene
MS. 1t is supposed to have been written between 1615 and 1620, and at
the end os the first part are the words, “Finis quod Skine,’' written ina
hand which bears a strong resemblance to many specimens of his which
have been preserved. The names ‘⁴ Magister Johannes Skeine,” and
“Magister Johannes Skeine, his book,'’ appear on two qs the ily-leaves.
The editor adds, ‘¹ the work bears internal evidence oi its having been
got up by a person oi taste and judgment, exhibiting occasionally a
simplicity, a beauty‚ and even a degree of eleganee which, from anything
we have seen of the productione os that age, we could scarcely have

expected'’ (p 15).
