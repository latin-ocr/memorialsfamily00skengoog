8 SKENE OF SKENE.

enveloped with a plaid over his left shoulder, and girded in his sword, and
his left hand curving up the shield, and in his right hand a Skene or
dagger guarding it, and on the sinister syd a Gillieweetfoot, with his
master's target on his left arme, and his doorlach pendant to his heels,
with short hoise, and rullions on his foot; and for his Crest a Crowne of

lawrell, with this motto over it, in a scroll, ‘virtutis regia merces! This .

coat was donum Regis, and not the douyer of a Herauld. . . .
“John Skene of y¹ ilk, who was father to the present Laird ol Skene,

. whose name is Alexander, was the Twentie-sevent Laird of Skene served

and retoured, as the breves and services by the Monsars [Macers] and ·
Sheriffe Court Books of Aberdene can witness.¹’ (1153.)

The third manuscript (MS.C) repeats the traditionary origin given by
Mr. Alexander Skene in 1678 ; but Sir John Cowpar, in introducing this
John Skene of that ilk to Lady Dundonald, adds four generations to the
twenty-seven given in the previous manuscript, and credits him with

In the next manuscript history (MSD) we find astill further develop-
ment of the story, extending, in the same manner, the antiquity of the
family. The author repeats the story in MS.B, but substitutes Malcolm the
Second as the King, and gives 1014 as the date, and then adds to it this
further account :-“ The first of this family we have now upon record is
John de Skeen, who lived in the reign of King Malcolm Canmore, after
whose death he had the misfortune to join Donald Bain, the usurper, who
was his near relative, for which he was most justly forfeited by King
Edgar. But afterwards, in the reign of King Alexander 1st, when that
monarch was marching against'the Rebels in the North, the Laird of
Skeen joined the Royal army, did them singular service in assisting thern
to pass the rivers, and in short behaved with such courage and mag-
nanimity against the King’s Enemies upon every occasion, that his
Majesty was graciously pleased to rehabilitate him, and restored unto him
his Estate of Skene, Anno 1118 (in the charter chest of the family), which
has been enjoyed by his posterity ever since.”

In another edition of this manuscript the story is thus told :-

“ The family, by the troublesome times which afterwards prevailed,
lost many of their charters and principal papers, so that there is very
little accounts of thirteen Lairds of Skene who succeeded one another,
from King Malcolm the second· to the time of King Robert the urum
