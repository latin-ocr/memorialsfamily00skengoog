Thomton, Dunninald, Brotherton, Usan, &c The Town Records of
Montrose, Bre'chin, Forlar, Arbroath, and Dundee are practically un·

touched sor this purpose, while in the Public Offices in Edinburgh
there must be unlimited stores.

From the enquiries made, as described above, the Com·
mittee are sully convinced ol the existence of a very large
amount of most interesting and valuable information,.suitable
for the compilation of Volumes either as Antiquities or as
Miscellanies. At the same time, however, it may be mentioned
that, both south and north os the Dee, the ground has already
been gone over sor works now published by other literary clubs,
though these works are more connected with Ecclesiastical
objects than with those ol Family History. Os such a character
are the Regt'strum Episcopatus A terdonensis, Regrstrum Episco-
patus Moraviensis, Liber Pluscardtnsis, and Recordr os tte
Monastery of K z'nloss, belonging to the three northern counties ;
and the Regr'strum Episcopatus Brechz'nensis, Registrum dt A ber·
brotlzoc, Regzstrum Przhratus S‘f A κάνεα, Regr'strum dt Pan·
mure, chartulary os C upar A bbey, and History of tlte carnegiss.
Earls os Soutlttsle, lor the two southern. But these have not
exhausted the field, especially in the direc'tion that is contem·
plated by this Committee.
