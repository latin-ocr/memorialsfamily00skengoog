And, close beside him, in the show,
Poor Yarmw, partner os their woe, '

Couches upon his masters breast,
And licks his cheeks to'break his rest. ·

Who envies now the shepherd's lot,
His healthy sare, his mrai cots
His summer conch by greenwood tree, ·
His rustic kirn’s* loud revelry,
His native hill notes tuned on high,
To Marion oi the blithesome eye; ,
His crook, his scrip, his oaten reed, ·
And all Arcadia's golden creed?

Changes not so with us, my skene, ⁸
Os human lise the varying scene?
Our youthiul summer oft we see
Dance by on wings οῖ’ game and glee,
While the dark storm reserves its rage‚
Against the winter os our age:
As he, the ancient Chies oi Troy,
His manhood spent in peace and j0y;
But Grecian hres, and loud alarms.
Call'd ancient Priam forth to arms.
Then happy those, since each must drain
His share os pleasure, share os pain,- Α
Then happy those, beloved os Heaven,
To whom the mingled cup is given ;
Whose lenient sorrows find relies,
Whose joys are chasten'd by their grief.
And such a lot, tny Skene‚ was thine,

When thou, os late, wert doom'd to twine,-
Just when thy bridal hour was by,-
The cypress with the myrtle tie

Just on thy bride her Sire had smiled‚
And biess'd the union ot' his child, ’
