third to Sir Robert Richardson ol Pencaitland-their sons have dis·
poned all their fathers' lands, and nothing is lest thereos at this day.''

The history of Sir John, aswell' as oi his son, Sir James, can be
traced lrom the iniancy of the former, and it will be seen that the author
ol the “ Staggering State ” has rather distorted the facts in order to point
the moral of his piece

We have first, two notices, which may relate to Sir John in his early
school days. On 13th July, 1541, the Town Council ot* Aberdeen “divide
the Sang skuill between Sir John Futtie 3ηά John Black, sin'gar, his
depute ; the said John to have power to puneis and correct his awin twa
brothers, Alexander Grayes twa sones, ane Skene and ane Lummisden,

barnis oi the said skuill, reserving the punysment oi the remanent barnis

¹ thereos to the said Sir John himself, as superior thairos.” 24th January,
1549, “Gilbert Kintor . . . conuilrit . . . for ye inpading oi daue
andersoun Doctor in ye grammer slruhill of ye said burl in sanct nicklaoe

with 3 Lumsden (and Sir john's mother was a Lumsden), 3ηά no doubt
much benefited by the punishment and correction he received from Mr.
John Black ; and then we find him leading the baims oi the Grarhmar
School, and showing his prowess in delending their master. Mr. Grant,
in his History of the Burgh Schools of Scotland, adds, “Tradition
says that the scholar called Skeyne was the famous Sir John Skeyne,
Clerk os Register, so ‚well known to the students ot* Scots law and
history ” (p. 63), and the dates accord; ior, aster passing through tlte
course ol studies at Kings College, Aberdeen, he went to the University
ot* St Andrews; and in 1556 Johannes Skenewas incorporated in St
Marus College After taking his degree ol Master oi Arts, he was, in
1565, Regent os St Mary’s College, 3ηά one oi the electore oi the
Rector. ·

Dempster, who was personally acquainted with him, says, in his
Ecclesiastical History,“ adolescentiam in Norwegia, Dania, Sannatiaqne
magna parte consumpsit, ubi et lingua didicit. mum horula-et
