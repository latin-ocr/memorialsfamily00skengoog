d, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway,-also os the

Scottish History Society.

The Council would here offer to the Club their opinion
that a select library os reference, sor the use ol the editors os
their works, and os the members generally, to be composed
bf books bearing on subjects within the scope os its operations,
would be a desirable addition to the working resources os the
Society; but this would, os course, entirely depend sor its progress

on our financial position, srorn time to time.

A statement ol that position, as it stands at present, will be
submitted by the Treasurer, and will be seen to justily the issue
of two volumes at an early date, in return lor the first year's

subscription*

1.-The first os these will be Vol. Ι. os the Cunnrunnnv on

ST. NICHOLAS, edited by the Rev. James Cooper, which,
had our anticipations been realised, would have been
delivered to members before this time. Reliance had been
placed on a transcriptos the Chartulary in the possession of
the Society os AdvocateS, but, on examination, this transcript
proved to be so fullos errors that considerable delay in the
issue of the book became unavoidable This first volume will
give the original textos the Charters, dcc, and will probably

. be ready in January next The second volume, to be issued

in a subsequent year, will give a summary, or abstract, os
each document, in English, with an historical introduction,
