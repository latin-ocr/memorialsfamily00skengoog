There can, l think, be little difficulty in identifying the compilerof these
two manuscripts with a Mr. Alexander Skene, a man of some note and
culture at the time, in Aberdeen, whose brother james, about the same
time, held the office os Lyon Depute. They were, as will afterwards
appear, sons of a Robert Skcne, merchant burgess of Aberdeen, and
treasurer of the burgh. Alexander, his eldest son, was born in 1621,
and admitted a burgess in 1625, when only four years old-“ jure
¹paternitatis et dispens. cum jurejurando quia pupillus est et infra
aetatem.'' ln 1648 he was a Master of Arts, as appears from a sasine
in favour “probi et discreti adolescentis magistri Alexandri Skene.''
ln 1656 he became a magistrate of the town, and in the same year was
chosen, as one of the nearest of kin, curator of John Skene of that ilk,

whom he addresses, in 1675, in a letter in the same charter chest, as
his “ beloved friend.’'

iheresm I rejoice in my portion.’‘
