made by the‘ said umquhile· Davidstraehan, since the date of lthe said
reversion, which is dated 16th May, 15-, ; therefore the said defendero
ought to be punished, their persons, goods, &c The case was sub-
mitted to arbitration on 22nd January‚1591·2,and it is probable¹ the
deeds referred to on both sides were found to be genuine, ason and
October, 1604, there is a special service, “Jacobus Skene de eodem
hares Alexandri Sirene de eodem patria ln terris et Baronia de Skene
terris de Tillibriloch Tilnahiltis Balnadodill Auchinmoir Auchorie et
Comanis infra Baronium de Ochterellone’' On the same day there is the
service of Katberine Stewart, “relicte dict quondam Alexandri Skene
suam vitalem reddimm et Margarete Skene relicte quondam Alexandri
Sirene de Lerter.”

On the 8th November, 111 the same year, James Skene is infeft in the
lands and barony of Skene, as heir servedand retoured to Alexander
Skene of that illr, his father, his procurator being ‘⁴ Honorabilis vir
Robertus Skeyne de Tillibroloch actomatus pro Jacobo Skene de eodem
sui patris.'’

’ James sireneos that ilk was upwards of sixty years old when he
moeeeded his father, and appears to have died within the year, as in 1605
Jobanna Skene or Douglas, widow of James Skene of that ilk, is served
to her terce. She was daughter of Sir Archibaid Douglas of Glenbervie,
and sister of the niuth Earl of Angus; married to him about 1563 ; and
it was through this marriage that the connection between- the families of
Glenbervie and Skene arose which led to MS.A being compiled in 1678.
- This James Skene of Skene had the following children :-
1. Alexander Skene, called ‘⁴ Barron of the Letter” (MSA). There is
· among the Skene papers a contract oi marriage in the year 1584,
, between Alexander Skene of that ilk, younger, with consent of
his father, James, then liferenter of Bandodle, and his grand-
father, Alexander Skene of that ilk; and Margaret Johnston,
daughter of Sir George Johnston of Caskieben, with whom he
got 5000 merks of tocher. Mr. Patrick Skene, sone lawful of
· Alexander Skene of that ilk, is a witness, buthe predeceased
both his father and grandfather, dying before 1599, as appears
· from a discharge by Margaret Skeyne, eldest lawful daughter to
umquhile Alexander Skeyne, har of that ilk, with assent of Maister

Duncan Forbes in Letter, and Robert and Alexander Skeyne,
