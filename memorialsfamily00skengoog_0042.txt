· SKENE OF SKENE. 17

Jame's Skene 01 Skene was thus married to‘the widow 01 Fraser of
Comtoun as early at least as the year 1428, and had, by his wife, a son,
Alexander, who succeeded him, and who was marriageable in 1438, as on
the 12th 01 ·May in that year, Egidia de Moravia, domina de Culbin, in her
widowhood, with consent 01 Alan 01 Kynnarde, her son and heir, granta
to Alexander Skene, son and heir 01 James Skene 01 that ilk, on account
01 the marriage to be contracted between him and Mariot of Kinarde
her daughter, the lands 01 Dulpoty, Estertown, and Mill 01 Dulpoty, in
the Barony 01 Culbin, and Sheriifdom'of Forres, in security 01 the sum
of ἦ 100 Scots, James Skene must therefore have been born long before
the year 141 1, when his father was killed at Harlaw, and the statement in
MS.D that Adam's successor was a posthumous child is plainly apocryphal.

The family seems now to have spread somewhat, as we find others 01
the same‘name appearing for the first time. Ι11 14300 Jacobus Skene
appears aa Notarius Publicus. In 1440a Fergusius de Skene is admitted
a burgess of Aberdeen, and in 1443 a John Skene. In the same year
Robertus Skene is “vicarius de Logymar,” and is again mentioned in
1477 3 and 111 1461 an Alexander Skene appears in the Town Council 01
Aberdeen. These scions 01 1110 family probably belonged to an old
branch of the family, the Skenes 01 Α1101110101110, in the parish 01
Logie Coldstone.

It was in the time 01 thia James of Skene that the family entered
into an arduous struggle with the more powerful family 01 the Earls
Marischal, to regain possession 01 the lands 01 Easter Skene, which had
been pledged 10 thern, 00 has been previously adverted to.

The family appears to have lost the original deed of impignoration or
wadset‚ 01111 commenced the contest by instructingby the evidence 01
witnesses, that such a deed had existed. There are still preserved, in the
Skene charter chest, two official reports, bya Commissioner appointed
for the purpose, 01 the evidence then taken. They are printed at length
1111011110 volume or the 1 Antiquitas or the sanes 01 Aberdeen and
Banff,” p. 318 ; but a short abstract may here be given :-

The first is dated 22nd September, 1446, and reports the evidence 01
three witnesses before a Court held in the Cathedral 01 Aberdeen. The
first witness, John Petlrame, being swom and examined, states that he
read a deed, written on parchment, conceming the impignoration seu
somalyn 01 the lands 01 Εο101 Skene, in favour 01 the late ,Lord William
