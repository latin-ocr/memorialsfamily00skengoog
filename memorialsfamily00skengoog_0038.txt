Chartulary of the Bishop'ric of Aberdeen (t. 57), but in· the same r'eign ”
Alan' Durward undoubtedly possessed extensive lands in the Earldom· of
Mar. These lands were acquired in consequence oi a claim made by his ·
father, Thomas Durward, before 1228, to 'the Earldom of Mar, and
renewed·by his son illan, in 1257. This claim seems to have been com·
promised by the Dunvards obtaining possession· of three hundred pound
land, partly in domuin (dominiis) and partly in holdings( iis), or
more, in tbe Earldom (Palgrave Records, p 22). Part, if not the whole,
of the Thanage of Kintore, including the lands of Skene, may thus, for
the time, have been ‚in his possession. The tenure orr which Thanagc
lands were held wasanalogous to that of lands held in feodofirma, that is,
for anennual money‘payment. Alan Durward is termed, in connection*
with Skene, “ Dominus.earundem,'’ and therefore held·it probably as
“a holding,” that is, the superiority only, and his grant of xxij shillings
to the Bishop was probably from the feu· rent due to him asoverlord·
Fordun tells us that Alan Durward died in 1275, and that his three
daughters succeeded to himin bis. lande, but these acquisitione to the
Earldom of Mar appear not to ,haye fallen under his succession, but to

’ have reuerted to the Crown. TheThanage· afterwards the Barony, of

Oneill, one of his principat possessione, appears to have been granted to
the Earls of Fife, and the possessione of the lands of Skene would now
coneto be held of the Crown, as we find was the case with John de
Skene and Patrick de Skene rn 1296 ..

lt rs quite possible that the family ol Skene rs at least as old as the
’ reign of William the Lion, and that Mr. Alexander Skene may be correct
in saylng that therehad been in the charter chest a restoration frorn for-

feiture by, that monarcb, for in 1174 there broke out in the north an
insurrection in favomof a Donald Bane MacWilliem, who held possession
