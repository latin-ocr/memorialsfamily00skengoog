INTRODUCTION TO CANTO FOURTH OF MARMION. 249

And thou, and 1, and dear-loved Rae,⁵
And one whose name l may not say,-†
For not Mimosa’s tendet tree
Shrinks sooner from the touch than he,-
ln mcny chorus well combined,
With laughter drown'd the whistling wind.
Mirth was within ; and Care without
Might gnaw her nails to hear our ehout
Not but amid the buxom scene =
Some grave discourse might intervene-
Oi the good horse that bore him best,
His shoulder‚ hooi, and areblng erest:
For, like mad Tom's‚‡ our ehi'ol'est nare,
We} horse to ride, and weapon wear.
'S'uch nights we've had; and, though tho gamo
Oi manhood be more sober ωηο,
And though the field-day, or the drill

Ι Seem less important now—yet still
Such may we hope to shore again.§
The sprightly thought inspires my strainl
And mark, how like a horsemun true,
Lord Marmion’s march 1 thus renew.
