This was followed on sth October, 1458, by a petition by Alexander
Skene, that his father might be preferred to the possession and rights of
said lands, and protestation that no decree to the contrary might prejudge
his undoubted right thereto; which appears to have been granted and the
grant again recalled, as on 12th October, 1459, there is again a protesta-
tion by Alexander Skene, as procurator lor his father, James Skene of
that ilk, before· the Parliament held at Perth, which narrates that after the
king had recognised his right, he had recalled his recognition, at the in-·
stance os Jonet de Kethe, and given her the lands “ adplegium,” contrary,

¹the said Alexander maintained, to the laws, rights, and statutes os the

y ‘realme and to the hurt, loss, and prejudice nithe said James Skene,

h

audon the partos the said James humbly pressed the king to replace
him in possession ol the said lands, according to the rights, customs, and
ancient laws ol the kingdom, and protested that the demising ol the
said lands to the said Jonet de Kethe ad plegium, should not prejudice
his rights in future, and that he should have free regress to these lands.
A similar protestation was made on 7th March, 1460. In the mean-
time, while his son and heir was carrying on this contest with their
powersul neighbours, the Keiths, his mother, the widow os Fraser os
Corutoun, had died, and his father had married a second time Giles
Murray os Cowbin, widow ol Thomas Kinnaird os that ilk‚ in 1458, lor

we lind an obligation by Alane ol Kynnardc ol that ilk, narrating that
“lorasmeikle as my tender fader James Skene os that ilk and Giles ol
Murranc of Skelb0, his spouse, has set to me all and sundrie the lands ol
Skelb0,¹ in the Earldom os Sutherland and Sheriffdom, &c'’

James Skene ol, Skene appears to have died in the year 1461.
