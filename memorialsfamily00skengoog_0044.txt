SKENE OF SKENE. 19

the Bishops of St Andrews and Aberdeen, against all persons detain-
ing or concealing said deed, and not revealing it to the said James
de Skene This public instmment was issued at the instance of the
said James de Skene, in presence of Ranald Chene of Crechie, John
Bumet of Leyis, David Scrymgeour, Andrew Buchan of Auchmacoy,
and Thomas Beset, witnesses.

This proceeding, however, seems to have lod to nothing, and James
of Skene appears, after a time, to have committed the conduct of the

struggle to his son and heir, Alexander Skene, at whose instance a second ’

examination of witnesses was made This inquiry took place in the
parish church of Kincardine, on the ninth day of November, 1456, when
a discreet man, John Yoill, was examined, and deponed that eight days
before the death of the late Sir John Yoill, vicar of Peterculter, the late
Lady of Keth‚ mother of the Lord William de Keth‚ now Marischal of
Sootland, came to the said Sir John Yoill, at Culter, when grievously sick
in bed, and interrogated him regarding the lands of Ester Skene, Ledach,
Kirktoun of Skene, Milboy, Garlogy, with the mill thereos, whether his
Lord, the Lord William de Keth Marischal‚ had a real right to the said
lands, orwhether, as she had often heard asserted, James Skene of that
illr had the right of reclaiming said lands, as belonging, by hereditary
right, to the Barony of Skene; to which Sir John Yoill answered, as he
should answer at the great day of judgment, that the Earl Marischal had
the said lands in sonnalyn, made by Adam de Skene for three hundred
merke, as contained in a certain deed; and further stated on oath, that

, the said Earl Marischal had no other rights from the said Adam to these

lande : whereupon the said Lady said, 'that the Lord Marischal possessed
these letters of sormalyng of the said lande of Skene, granted by the said
Adam de Skene, and nothing else. Interrogated who were then present,
said only the Lady of Keth and Sir John Yoill, with himself. Interro-
gated how it came there were not more, stated, on oath, that the said
Lady caused several others to leave the room, and retained him to serve at
mass in the room, asserting him to be hereafter a native man to his Lord,
the said Marischal; and that he made this deposition without party or
prejudioe, hatred or love, in presence of Master William of Coultis, vicar
of Tarlane, Alexander erin of Stradie, of Strathachyn, and
Kennocht of Cragmyle, with many others.
