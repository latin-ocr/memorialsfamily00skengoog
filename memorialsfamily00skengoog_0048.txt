In 1504 he acquired, from David Strathaquhyn of Carmyle‚ certain
lands in the parish of Kinnemie, which bounds the lands of Skene on
the west, as appears by charter granted on 16th April in that year, by
“David Strathaquhyn de Carmyle et Dominus de Tulibrochloch dilecto
meo Alexandro Skene de Eodem terras meas de Tullibrochloch Tulyna-
hiltis Balnadodill curn le Cumeris Auchquhory et molendino ejusdem ;”
and among the witnesses is Johannes Skeyne This charter is confirmed
on 17th April by Johannes Comes Crawfurdiae et Dominus de Lyndesay‚
the Superior3 and on the 22nd April he was infeft in these lands. The
lands thus conveyed to him, consisting of five separate possessions
adjoining the lands of Skene, formed what were called Tanistry lands‚
in order to make a provision for the younger sons of the family, who
occupied thern during their lives as kindlie tenants.

Alexander appears to have died in the year 1507, as towards the end ⁴
of that year, on rath February, 1507-8‚ there is in the Privy Seal Record a
letter to Sir Alexander Irving of Dntm and Duncan Forbes of the
ward of the lands of the late Alexander Skene of that ilk, and of the

’ marriage of Alexander Skene, his son and heir ; and on the third day of

October, 1508, Agnes Forbes is served by a jury assembled at Aberdeen,
before John, Earl of Crawfurd‚ and Lord Lyndesay‚ “qui jurati dicunt
quod Agnes Forbes relicta Alexandri Sirene de eodem tenetur habere
racionabilem terciam omnium terrarum baronie de Skene exceptis
duabus partibus terrarum de Lattir que attigit habere suam terciam in
solari parte hujusmodi terrarum.” .

This Agnes Forbes, according to MS. authority, was a daughter of
Lord Forbes, probably of James‚ second Baron Forbes, by Egidia de
Keith‚ daughter of William, First Earl Marischal, and was thus sister of
that Duncan Forbes who was one of the guardians of her infant son. By
her Alexander Skene had two sons-

1. Alexander Skene, who succeeded him.
11. James Skene, kindlie tenant of Bandodill, ancestor of the families of
Skene of Ramore, Curriehill, Halyards in Midlothian, and Rubislaw.
