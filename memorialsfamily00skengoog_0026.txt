In 1685 there appeared in Aberdeen a work with the title os
“Memorialls ior the Government oi the Royall-Burghs in Scotland.
By ΦΙΛΟΠΟΛΙΤΕΙΟΥΣ, or a lover of the Publick wellfare ¹'; and, in the
same year, “A Succinct Survey os the iamous City oi Aberdeen. By
aZealous Lover of Bon-Accord, ‘HAOHOAITEIOYZ” That Baillie
Alexander Skene was the author appears from an entry in the Council
Register in the same year—‘⁴ the little book latlie emitted be Mr Alexr
Skene late baille dedicat to the Magrats and Counsell . . . . to get
tuentie thereos ior the touns vse'’ (vol. lvii, p. 198).

His position, his literary character, and his connection with the iamily
os Sirene of Skene necessarily give great weight to his account os the
family, and especially to that period when he must have been personally
cognisant os the iacts he narrates

The second manuscript history, in point os date (MS.B), is unfortunately
anonymous. lts title is “Some special Accounts conceming the house
oi Skene,” and it belonged to the late Andrew Slrene, advocate, Solicitor-
General ior Scotland. This account, however, must have been written
between the years 1680⁸and 1724, as the writer mentions, “John Skene
os that ilk, who was father to the present Laird of Skene, whose name
is Alexander,'’ and Alexander succeeded his father in 1680, and died in
1724 From its silence as to* later events, it was probably written not
long aiter the former date.

Ol the third manuscript (Mac) we can give a more distinct account. lts
title is “ Ane account os Sir john Skene, Lord Curriehill, Clerl( Register,
his Predecessors and Successors'’; and there is this docquet-“ This
account was written by Mr. Robert Cowpar, brother to Sir John Cowpar
os Gogar, who died in the 9oth year of his age in the year 1726, at Ι
Balherton, in Midlothian, near Edinburgh. Sir John Cowpar’s father was
married (as per the account) to Mr. John Skene oi Halyards, one oi the
principal Clerlrs of Session, his eldest daughter, Helen Skene; and Mr.
John Skene os Halyards was Sir John's second son, who was a son of
Skene oi Raemoir's, the eldest cadet of the iamily of Skene os that ilk,
now gone into the name ol Hog, by the heiress marrying this Raemoir’s
father, who was first oi that name. This is copied out os the original
manuscript by John Ramsay oi Menies, lineally descended of the family
of Dalhousie, Anno 1727.’' This account, therefore, belongs to the same
period with the previous manuscript.
