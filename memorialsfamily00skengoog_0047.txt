Vll-Anaxnnoan ori Suana-1461-1470.

There is, on 1st June, 1461, a sasine in favour oi Alexander Skene os
that ilk, as heir to the said james, his father, os the lands and barony os
Skene, following upon a retour and precept oi Chancery.

Soon after, his contest with the Keith family seems to have been
brought to a conclusion, at least ior the time,· in his favour, a result to
which the marriage ol his half-brother, Alan of Kinnarde, with his
antagonist, Janet oi Keith‚ may have contributed; ior, on 18th May, 1464,
there is a sasine in favour oi Alexander Skene de eodem on a charter
from William Earl Marischall‚ of the lands os “Leddach de Skene Kirkton
de Skene Milbuy et Garlogy in Baronia de Skene ;” and the close con· ⁸
nection with the Kinnards is still further evinced from a charter of
Balerdmund‚ in the Skene charter chest, granted in 1467 by Alanus de
Kynnarde “dilecto fratri nostro naturali Alexandro Skene de eodem.
Testibus Gilberto Skene nepote meo Magistro Roberto Skene.”

- The term naturalis did not at that time imply bastardy but the
reverse. It was opposed to the terms carnales and bastardus.
