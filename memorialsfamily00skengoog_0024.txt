MEMORIALS OF THE FAMILY OF SKENE OF SKENE.

INTRODUCTlON.

HE materials for a history of the ancient Aberdeenshire Family

of Skene of Slrene are more than usually abundant They
consist of the family papers in the charter chest of Sirene of Skene,
in the possession of the Earl of Fife, now the heir of line of the family;
those in the charter chest of the family of Rubislaw, and in that of the
family of Curriehill and Halyards‚ which fell to the late James Skene of

Rubislaw, on the failure of that branch; and five manuscript bistones,
compiled at different times.

The oldest of these (Msn) is a manuscript bearing the following
title, “ Origo nominis necnon familiae de Slrein,” and concluding with the
following docquet, “Thir presents are exhibited by a wellwisher of both
the families‚ via, the Laird of Glenbervie‚ called Douglas‚ whose draught
thereof is wrytten by Mr. Alexander Skene, Aberdeen, 22 January‚
1678.¹' This Mr. Alexander Skene is obviously also the compilet of
another manuscript, containing coats of arms of all the principal Scottish
families. The Skene families among them are—“ Skene of that illc, G. 3
