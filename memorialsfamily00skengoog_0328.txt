German writer, Vamhagen von Ense, informs the Secretary that
manuscripts exist in the Royal archives at Berlin which would

be os service in the compilation os an exhaustive biography ol
that distinguished son of N orth-Eastern Scotland. He suggests
that such a work would be peculiarly appropriate as one to be
undertaken by the New Spalding Club. The same idea had
occurred to several of our members and the Rev. Andrew
Chalmers, Wakefield, calls our attention to similar material pre·
served in the Library of the University of Berlin. lt is to be hoped
that this proposal may bear fruit, and⁴that a suitable editor may
he found lor avolume dealing not merely with the life of James
Keith, but with the almost equally interesting though less-known
career of his elder brother, George, the last os the Earls Marischal.
lndeed a history of the Keith Family generally, giving authentic
accounts of its many members who have gained distinction in
different spheres os public life, would be singularly attractive in
itsell, and, we cannot doubt, would be received with much accept·
ance by our members.
