The wild unbounded hills we ranged
While oft our talk its topic changed

And, desultory as our way,

Ranged‚ unconfined, from grave to gay.
Even when it llaggd, as ost will chance
No eisort rnade to break its nance,

We could right pleasantly parsue

Our sports in social silence too;

Thou gravely labouring to pourtray

The hlighted oale's fantastic spray;

l spelling o'er‚ with much delight,

The legend oi that antique knight,
Tirante hy name, yelep'd the White.

At either‘s ieet a trusty equire, ⁸
Pandour and Cama* with eyes of lire,
Jealous, each other's motions view’d,

And scarce suppress'd their ancient seud.
The laverock whistled horn the cloud;
The stream was lively, but not loud;
From the white thorn the May-flower shed
Its dewy fragrance round ouahead:

Not Ariel lived more merrily ,
Under the blossom’d bough than we .-

And blithesomeaights, too, have been ours,
When Winter stript the summer's howers.
Careless we heard, what now 1 hear, .
The wild blast sighing deep and drear,

When fires were bright, and lamps beam’d gay,
And ladies tuned the lovely lay.

And he was held a laggard soul,

Who shunn'd to quaff the sparkli'ng bowl.
Then he'whose absence wa deplere,

Who breathes the galea of Devon's share,

The longer miss’d bewail'd the more ;
