pleased, and they went together to her lodging. Sir John Cowpar‚ intro-
ducing him to the Countess of Dundonald‚ told her he had brought her ἱ

Chief the Laird of Skene to wait upon her. She received him with great
joy and kindness, being the person in the world she longed to see, being
her chief, and hearing that he was ane old family—⁴ But, Skene, 1 would
gladly know what you can produce to instruct your antiquity?¹ ‘ Ι can
instruct, in mycharter-chest, one-andthirtyservices and retourS, from father
to son, and not a daughter intervening ;' whereupon she called upon the
Earl of Dundonald‚ and gave him account of what Skene told her; the
Earl being so well pleased that he embraced him and carried him to his
foreroom, where there were several noblemen in crlmpany with the Earl,
and desired them to take his Lady's chief by the hand, who could say
that which, he believed, none of them could say the like. ‘This Laird of
Skene can produce, lying in his charter chest, thirty-one services and
retours, from father to son, and not a daughter intervening ;’ which all of
them declared there was none os them could say the like, and that it was ’

could say the like, and it would have been “ane honest and old evidence”
if the retours could have been produced ; but that the old laird’s son was
the thirty-third from father to son, was simply a matter of traditionary
belief, evidently derived from the legendary origin of the family. Taking
the average length os a generation in the Skene family, which, from the
¹early marriages of the lairds, is unusually small, thirty-one generations
would take us back to the eleventh century, and through a period when
there were no such documents as services and retours.

The traditionary origin of the family is thus given by Mr. Alexander
Skene, in 1678 :—

“ Ane old tradition yr is that the tribe and family of Skein had their
origin from Struan Robertson of Athole, and they from McDonald, and
yt our first author was a son of the Laird of Struans, and had his first
donation immediately from the king, for killing ane devouring wolfe in
the forest, near the freddom land of Aberdeen, for which he got ye
confirmation of East and Wester Skein, to the freedom of Abda, and

act, viz, 3 wolfs heads erazed upon the points of 3 Skeens, triumphant
