“George Skene‚ a minor, succeeded his father in 1776, chose the
profession of the army, and was sent to Douay, in France, to promote
his studies at the military academy there, and upon his return got a
commission in the 46th Regiment of Foot, then in 1reland, where he
remained three years ; and, having attained the rank of lieutenant‚
returned to Scotland near the close of his minority‚ in order to be served
heir to his father, an event which, though then in the vigour of health
and youth, it was not his fate to accomplish He had gone to Aber-
deenshire for that purpose, in summer, 1791, from whence‘he proceeded,
for his amusement, to visit the Highlands, travelling on horseback, in the
course of which he stopped at Nairn, on a very stormy night of rain,
when a family with ladies arrived late, whom, as the house was full, it was
impossible to accommodate, and they, being averse to proceed further,
during bad weather, unfortunately applied to Mr. Skene to give up his room.
With this request he generously complied, though unwell at the time,
ordered his horse, and set off to ride to lnvemess in a cold and stormy
night, where he arrived, 'drenched with rain. An access of sever was the
natural consequence, which he incautiously disregarded, and proceeded
next day to visit Beauly, where it became so violent that it was necessary
to send back to lnvemess for a carriage to reconvey him there to Ettles’
inn, where, in two days afterwards, he expirod in presence of Mr. Ettles,
the landlord, who narrated the circumstances afterwards to me. His
body was conveyed to Aberdcen, and interred in the family burying-
ground in St Nicholas Churchyard, but a wcek after he had lest that
town, in the bloom of health and youth, on the 3oth September, 1791,
in his 21st year'' (MSE)
