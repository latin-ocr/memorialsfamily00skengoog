w'erc ¹prbper 'parts and pendicles,” a're dissolved, disunit‘ed,'and separated,
“with 'the'rig'ht of patrohage and title of the teynd's rexue of the samen kirlrs
from-'the forsaid kirk and benefice of Kinkell,'’ and decla'red “to be
seberall and 'distinct paroche'lrirkis arid' -parochines be thameselffis, and
no'way'es' to‘be part's and pendicles of 'the said kirlr of Kinlreli, benefice
and personage theirof, in all tyme conieing'.”—iActs of Pari. vi., pt. ·ii., 183)ss
⁴· This· parsonage of Kinkell was, as its name implies‚ the plebania or
mother ch'ur'ch of the great Thanage of Kintore; and the lands attached
to th'e other dependent vicarage's all belonged to the Thanage .1t. is
therefore probable that' the lands of Skene originally formed part of· the
Thanag'c of Kintore; and the narrative is probably correct which
describes it as forming part of an extended forest, for that part of' the
parish of Kint'ore which bourdet on the n'o'rth, was the “foresta dc
Kimor'e,'' and at the northern extremity of the forest was theold tower of

Hali Forest, believed to have been a hunting seat* of 'the Scottish iringa. ,

It is thus described—“ Hali Forest [a roy'al castle], according to tradition,
was built by King Robert Bruce for a hunting halt lt consisted of four
stories, having battlements, besides what is called a Capehouse, with a
moveable ladder, by'which those who occasionally lodged in it, entered
to the first floor. The Earl *Marischalh having acquired a right to it from
the Crown, presented it to his son, the first Earl of Kintorc''-'<Kennedy's
“Annals of Aberdeen,” vol. ii, p. 323). That the old tower oi Sirene was
an'analogous structure, will appear from the description of irgiven in one
of the MS. historica of the family—“ The Tower, or old house, still
stands, which was originally built of three arches or stories, and entered
by a ladder oh the second story. It was covered with a moimd of earth
upon the top of the third arch, and is all 'built with lime, quite run to-
gether or vitrilied, and the walls about ten feet thick. lt continued in its
original state till about the year 1680, that the arches being taken out, it
was roofed and lloored by jean Bumet‚ Lady Skene, Relict of John
Skene oi that illr, in her widowhood, andmalres now a part of the
accommodatiori of the present house”—iMS.D) Both tovers, however,
belong, from the style oi their architecture, to a inuch earlier period than
tile reign of King Robert Bruce‚ anrl were probably erected not later than
ln the twolsth century. > ¹
